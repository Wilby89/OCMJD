======= 1. Overview =======

This application is designed to aid the URLyBird customer service representative
(CSR) in booking hotel rooms for their customer.
It allows the CSR to view available rooms and offers the functionality to search 
by hotel name and/or location in addition to room booking.
The list of rooms are retrieved from a database file.



======= 2. How to run the application =======

The steps for running the application in all 3 modes are almost identical. To
run the jar navigate to the directory that the jar is placed in and in command line run the command:

    java -jar runme.jar <mode>

In client mode the <mode> can be omitted like so: java -jar runme.jar    
    Client mode must be run in combination with a running server, 
    if there is no server the application will display an error and shut down.

In server mode the <mode> is given as: java -jar runme.jar server
    This starts the server application.

In standalone client mode the mode is given as: java -jar runme.jar alone
    This starts the client in local mode.



======= 3. Configuring the application =======

When the application starts up in any mode a configuration window is displayed to
the user. When the user enters valid parameters they will be saved in a properties file
called suncertify.properties. 
If the application starts up and detects an existing properties file it will 
load the values from the file to save the user re-typing them. the properties file 
will then be overwritten with the values from the new start up.



======= 3. Running the server application =======

To start the server application the user must run the following command from the command line:

    java -jar runme.jar server

This will open up
