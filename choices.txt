==================== URLyBird application design choices ====================


I chose to use constants since the values of the constant shouldn't change.
Could have read these values from the properties file but would have been outside scope/unnecessary work

I chose to use a conversion method in my room object to get CSR, set CSR 
     * and then return a String[] containing existing record with a new CSR
