======= 1. Code style =======

Javadoc
    I have added javadoc to every class and all methods, regardless of access modifier. 
This is partly to avoid having to use single line comments within private methods. See below on Single line comments.

Class/Method naming
    I have tried to use intuitive and expressive names for classes and methods so
it is immediately obvious what the role of a class/method's role is.

Single line comments
    I tried to avoid single line comments, the code is meant to be understood by
a junior developer so the javadoc comment for each method should be sufficient. 
There are a few single line comments where I felt the code needed additional 
clarification and a large single line explaining my omission of the DuplicateKeyException.



======= 2. Networking decisions =======

RMI vs Sockets
    I decided to use RMI because it is easier to implement the network communication
in RMI, RMI is object oriented and is not limited to a single platform.
RMI also uses less code than sockets.
Conversely sockets gives the developer more low level control than RMI, RMI does not give the
developer control over threads being created.

Factory pattern
    I used the factory pattern for creating RMI objects. The factory is put in the
naming service and a client attempting to get a connection retrieves a connection
client from the factory.

Facade pattern
    I used the facade pattern

======= 3. Database decisions =======

Object class
    In the spirit of Object Oriented programming I created a Room POJO for record representation
to handle get and set attributes on a record. I also added a toStringArray method which returns
the record as a String array

Delegation pattern
    I used the delegation pattern to delegate the responsibility of the Data class to
the DataDBAccess class, keeping Data clean and small, if I put all the functionality in the Data
class it would balloon to over 500 lines.

DuplicateKeyException
    I chose not to throw the DuplicateKeyException as I saw an issue with how it could be implemented.
I could not see a unique identifier to make a primary key. To my mind, if the data in two separate
records was identical, e.g. hotel name and location and maximum occupancy etc was exactly the same it
would not necessarily be a duplicate.
Since we are not given room numbers for hotel rooms the hotel name, location, maximum occupancy, smoking status,
price, date available and CSR number could be the same and still refer to different rooms.
Imagine a scenario where a CSR books multiple rooms for something like a wedding party, the CSR number would
be the same, so would dates and they would likely get rooms close to each other, so similar rooms.
To avoid getting off the point: Without a unique identifier like room number, I did not
feel comfortable implementing the DuplicateKeyException.
Also it was not a 'must' requirement.

RandomAccessFile
    I used RandomAccessFile to read/write to the database file. This was my first time 
using RandomAccessFile but I found it easy to use and efficient. I did research on RandomAccessFile
vs FileInputStream/FileOutputStream which I had used before. RandomAccessFile can use one instance to 
both read and write and the seek() method is noticeably faster than FileInputStream's skip() method when
reading the file.



======= 4. Property file decisions =======

PropertyManager
    I utilized a singleton PropertyManager class to deal with persistence of properties.
The property manager deals with saving and loading of persistent properties and creates
a suncertify.properties file if the application can not find an existing one.

======= 5. Concurrency and locking decisions =======

I chose to avoid using the built in lock packages in Java in the package java.util.concurrent.
This is because I was unfamiliar with the classes and I was more comfortable with
synchronization. Also, I thought using synchronization would be simpler for a junior 
programmer to understand.

Locking map
    I utilized a singleton LockManager class with a HashMap, the HashMap is populated
with a record number as the key and a long as the value.
The long is obtained by the thread id of the current client thread.
The locking procedure consists of a call to lock a record, which adds the record number and the client thread id
into the HashMap, these calls in the HotelFrameController are not synchronized because 
a call to lock will block other threads wishing to access the record while the record number
is in the locking HashMap.
The next call is to update, which checks the current thread id is the owner of the lock of the record.
The final call unlocks the record, this is in the finally block of a try-catch to
ensure the call is made to unlock even if an exception is caught.




======= 6. GUI and usability decisions =======

Configuration GUI
    The configuration dialog is common to the three application start-up modes.
Depending on the mode in which the application is started then some components will be disabled.
In standalone client mode -
    Only the database location needs to be entered, host name and port are not editable.
In network client mode - 
    The RMI host name and port need to be entered, database location is not editable.
In server mode -
    The RMI port number and database location have to be entered, host name is set to
localhost by default.

HotelFrame GUI
    I chose not to limit the visibility of records to the user, so all records are displayed in the JTable, rather than
only displaying bookable records e.g records violating 48 hour rule or records already booked
by CSR. See Section 7 for additional 48-hour rationale.
I chose to load all records in the database on application start up, this was a purely
aesthetic decision on my part.
When the user attempts to book a room I implemented validation to make sure that a record has been
selected, then a JDialog user input is verified as being 8 characters long and all digits.

Server GUI
    I decided that rather than having a simple start server button that I would display the 
options that the server is using to start as un-editable text fields. The server then has an exit button
and the start server button is disabled as soon as the server is started.



======= 7. General decision and considerations =======

48-hour rule
    I decided against implementing the 48 hour rule as the dates in the database file
are all years in the past. I did not see any point in implementing code that would never be used.
If the dates were in the future then simple implementation in the GUI code to ensure that only bookable 
entries are displayed to the user could have been added in. 
However since I validate the magic cookie in the database file the application is locked
to the specific database I received which has all old dates.
It was also not a 'must' requirement.

Packaging structure
    I divided the application structure into five packages, the application is 
started from the StartUp.java class which I placed into the suncertify.init package
on it's own. 
The suncertify.util package is used to contain classes that can be used to 
provide common functionality across the application.
The other packages are self-explanatory.

Model View Controller architecture pattern
    I used a passive implementation model view controller pattern because it was a good fit for what I needed
in the client side code and Swing implementation.
In my application the model is represented by the AbstractTableModel and the information to be sent to
the user. I say passive implementation as my model does not notify the view and controller 
when there has been a change in state/information, the user must manually refresh the table data through
the Load table button or search button with no criteria. I could have used the observer pattern as a method
of notifying the view and controller but did not feel there was sufficient need.
The controller is represented by the HotelFrameController which is a class common to both the network
and stand alone clients. It creates the network/direct connection depending on application mode.
The controller also calls the lock/update/unlock/find/read methods in the data layer through the 
controller methods.
The view is represented by the HotelFrame class, it constructs the Swing GUI components and displays the data in the model.

Logging
    I used extensive logging in the application, logging as Level.SEVERE for caught exceptions and
    as Level.INFO for informative messages in the application flow
